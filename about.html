        <h2>About the Tech</h2>
        <p>I am a dedicated and enthusiastic professional with three years' experience in the technology field. I have a high interest in cybersecurity, more specifically, network security. Through my undergraduate courses at Saginaw Valley State University (SVSU), I have gained academic experience with multiple programming languages, network administration, project management, and more. With my honest and self-motivated characteristics, I am currently seeking for an opportunity to work on a team to obtain experience in the computer network field of Information Technology.</p>

        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>I am currently working on a research project with one of my computer science and information systems (CSIS) professors. The topic is regarding software-defined networking and its functions.</p>

        <h3>Campus Life</h3>
        <p>I am proud to say that I am a highly engaged on SVSU's campus. I am an active member in two registered student organizations (RSO) on campus.</p>
        <p>The first is the Optimistic club (OC), of which I am co-founder of. As a dedicated member of OC, our goal is to raise campus charisma, promote a positive perspective on everyday life, and to spread the optimism of happiness through others. We take time out of our busy schedule to assist the community with local community service activities and participate in as many RSO events as we can on campus.</p>
        <p>The second is the international Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). Within ACM, professionals from all over Michigan are welcomed to discuss their careers within the companies they work for. With IT jobs on the rise, this provides us the opportunity to find out what companies are looking for future IT workers currently. We have been honored to have companies such as Auto Owners and Nexteer visit us to explain the openings they have available to fill, whether it be for full-time positions or for internships. We host events for the community on the SVSU campus, also. We are known to hold the annual High School Programming Competition (HSPC) within the computer labs of SVSU. High school students from around Michigan car-pool in to participate in this event. Our last event, in March 2017, hosted over 150 students. I assisted in this event by monitoring a room with around 25 to 30 high school students. I was responsible for making sure students were not using outside sources and, if necessary, provided technical service for the students if there was a problem with the software they were using.</p>
